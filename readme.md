## psm
psm is an assembler for [pixy](https://circuitverse.org/27264/projects/pixy-indev) written in JavaScript.

#### include in your site

```html
<script src='scripts/psm.js' async></script>
```

#### produce pixy binaries

```js
psm(`
  # count down from 10
  mov a, 10
  mov b, 1234 # tty stdout address
  loop: add a, 0
  bz $end
  sub a, 1
  sto a, b
  b $loop
  end: pass
`)

## future

Note that psm and pixy are still in alpha so need a lot more work.
* refactor original code 
* make production code even smaller
* create a more robust parser
* sort out contention errors in pixy
